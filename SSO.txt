Instructions for setting up SSO in production.

First, we need to update our own shibboleth configuration to claim the domain name ‘isaw.nyu.edu’.
This will happen in the following places:

* In `/etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml`

  * There are three locations where the domain appears:

    * in the <Site> tag near the top, the “name” attribute of the tag is set to
      isaw4-new.atlantides.org and must be changed to isaw.nyu.edu

    * In the <RequestMapper> tag, there is a <RequestMap> tag, with a
      <Host> tag contained, the “name” attribute of which must be updated

    * In the <ApplicationDefaults> tag, the “entityID” attribute needs to be
      updated.  It must be the full URL of the new site, not just the domain
      name.

  * The <CredentialResolver> tag must be updated so that the “key” and
    “certificate” attributes point to the valid key and certificate for the isaw.nyu.edu
    server (I think they already do point to the right place, but check to be sure)

Second, you’ll need to update the url for the shibboleth IdP to point to the nyu production provider

* In `/etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml`

  * In the <SessionInitiator type=“Chaining"> tag, the “entityID” attribute must be updated 
  (urn:mace:incommon:nyu.edu)
  * In the contained <SessionInitiator type=“SAML2”> tag, the “entityID” attribute must be updated 
  (urn:mace:incommon:nyu.edu)
  * In the <MetadataProvider type=“Chaining”> tag, the “uri" for the first <Metadata type=“XML”> tag must be 
  updated (https://shibboleth.nyu.edu/idp/shibboleth)

Third, that last metadata tag points to a file backup of the metadata from the IdP, it is called “idp-metadata.xml” 
and you’ll need to place the metadata from the production IdP into a file by that name in the /etc/shibboleth 
directory.

Fourth, the `/etc/shibboleth/native.logger’, `/etc/shibboleth/syslog.logger` and `/etc/shibboleth/shibd.logger` 
have all been set up to use DEBUG for all logging.  This results in over-long log files and so please return all 
logging levels in these files to INFO.

Finally, the Apache config files for http and https will need to be updated to server the correct domain names.

NOTE: There's a chance the metadata produced by the new server will be needed by ISAW's SSO people to update the 
configuration. There's a copy of this metadata in the conf directory in this buildout.
