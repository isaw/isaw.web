                Staff and faculty members with ISAW-owned computers should already be set up with a wired (ethernet) network connection in your workspace.

                Anyone with an&nbsp;<strong>NYU netid</strong>&nbsp;(see above) must use that netid to get onto the wireless network (wifi) at ISAW or anywhere else on the NYU campus. NYU Information Technology Services (ITS) provides the high-speed wireless network at ISAW, and they also provide excellent &quot;how-to&quot; documents for getting connected:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/wireless/">http://www.nyu.edu/its/wireless/</a>.</div>

            <div>
                NYU and ISAW use a &quot;Single Sign-On&quot; system for most affiliated websites, as well as your NYU/Google email account and NYU/Google Calendar. That means you just use your<strong>&nbsp;NYU netid</strong>&nbsp;and associated password whenever you need to login. Some NYU sites will have a &quot;login&quot; link that you have to click; others will automatically direct you to the NYU Login page, where you can enter your&nbsp;credentials. If you haven&#39;t activated your NYU netid yet (see above), then you will not be able to login! We recommend you try logging into the ISAW website now to make sure it works. Try visiting the ISAW Employee Guide, which requires you to login with your NYU netid:&nbsp;<a href="https://isaw.nyu.edu/about/employee">https://isaw.nyu.edu/about/employee</a>.</div>

To help, we recommended that you use a password manager that plugs into your web browser, storing your passwords in an encrypted format and automatically entering them on web forms when needed. We recommend (and use ourselves)&nbsp;<a href="http://lastpass.com/">Lastpass</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://1password.com/">1Password</a>&nbsp;for this purpose.</div>
